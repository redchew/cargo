Pindrop   {#pindrop_readme}
=======

## Overview

Pindrop is a simple-to-use, open-source, cross-platform audio library designed
for games.

Go to our [landing page][] to browse our documentation and see some examples.

## Features

  * Distance Attenuation
  * Channel Prioritization
  * Sound Bank Management
  * Built on [SDL][]

## Dependencies

Pindrop depends on the following libraries:

  * [FlatBuffers][]
  * [SDL][]
  * [SDL_Mixer][]
  * [libogg][]
  * [libvorbis][]

**Important**: The Pindrop audio library requires these submodules, so download
the source using:

~~~{.sh}
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/pindrop.git
~~~

Additionally, on Linux you will need:

  * [osspd][]

## Notes

For applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.
This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string
(`pindrop_version_string`), and helps us continue to optimize it.  Aside from
consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect your
application at all.  We use this information to let us know if Pindrop is useful
and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open source, you are
free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if you would leave it
in.
