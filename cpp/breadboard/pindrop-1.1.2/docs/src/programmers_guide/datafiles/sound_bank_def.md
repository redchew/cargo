SoundBankDef    {#pindrop_guide_sound_bank_def}
============

A `SoundBankDef` is simply a list of [SoundCollectionDef][]s to load. Each
`[SoundCollectionDef][] will be loaded only once, so there is no need to worry
about specifying a [SoundCollectionDef][] in multiple `SoundBankDef`s.
`SoundBankDef`s allow you to decide how much memory you want to devote to audio
assets and manage groups of them together.
